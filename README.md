# Power Pong

### Power Pong is a variation of the classic game Pong that features power-ups that players can use to gain an advantage over their opponent. The game is designed for two players and can be played on a computer.

### Gameplay:

Power Pong is played on a rectangular screen with two paddles, one controlled by each player, and a ball that bounces back and forth between them. The goal of the game is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle and score a point. The first player to reach a certain number of points (e.g. 10) wins the game. The game will start with a countdown of 3,2,1,Go!
Players can control their paddles using a keyboard. The game will have a pause button, in case of any interruptions

### Power-Ups:

Increase the size of the paddle: This power-up temporarily increases the size of the player's paddle, making it easier to hit the ball.

Decrease the size of the opponent's paddle: This power-up temporarily decreases the size of the opponent's paddle, making it harder for them to hit the ball.

Increase the speed of your next shot: This power-up temporarily increases the speed of the player's next shot, making it harder for the opponent to react.

### Power-Up Pick-Up:

Power-ups will appear on the screen randomly during gameplay. The ball can collide with the power-up to pick it up. The player who collides with the ball last will be the one who gets to use it. The power-up will be displayed on the top left corner of the screen, so that the player can know which power up they have picked up.

### Art and Sound:

The game will have retro style art, with a clean and simple design. The game will have background music and sound effects for the power-ups and collisions.


### Platform:

Power Pong can be played on a PC. 

### Future Features:

Multiplayer support: Power Pong will have the option for online multiplayer, allowing players to compete against others from around the world.

Leaderboard: Players will be able to view the leaderboard of the highest scores and compete with other players for the top spot.

Customizable paddles: Players will be able to unlock and purchase different designs for their paddles as they progress through the game.

Difficulty settings: The game will have different difficulty settings, such as easy, medium and hard, to cater to players of different skill levels. Similar to the CC mechanic seen in nintendo's Mario Kart, the different difficulty levels correspond to how fast the ball is. 

#### Development:

The game will be developed using the Unity game engine.
The game will be developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
The game will be developed in C# programming language.

### Conclusion:

Power Pong is an exciting new twist on the classic game of Pong that offers players a variety of power-ups and customization options. With its retro style art, engaging gameplay, and online multiplayer support, Power Pong is sure to be a hit with players of all ages.
